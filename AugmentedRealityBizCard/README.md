# Augmented Reality Business Card

Augmented Reality (AR) business cards where I have used AR.js library which offers marker tracking as mentioned above. Also to display the web application on browser I have used HTML and CSS languages.

# Steps to work

1. User needs to run the index.html file.
2. Provide the camera permissions.
3. Show the HIRO Marker in front of camera pointer.
4. User will be able to see the AR business card on screen.
